# Dashboard
I've crafted a project dashboard using the MERN stack, incorporating MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for backend functionality, React.js for a dynamic frontend, and Node.js for server-side operations. The dashboard centralizes project records, providing essential details like project name, description, and status. Features include a summary section, search and filter options, responsive design, and the ability to add/edit projects. The MERN stack's synergy ensures efficiency, and the dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for seamless project management. The integration of data visualization tools enhances insights into project distribution and progress.
